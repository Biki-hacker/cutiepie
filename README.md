# 💕 Cute Love Proposal App 💕

A super playful React + Vite frontend web app made for fun!  
It’s filled with **cute characters, funny pickup lines, gifs, and cheeky interactions** to make someone smile. 💖  

### ✨ How it works:
- First page: A cute character pops up asking *"Will you be my girlfriend?"* with **Yes** and **No** buttons.  
- Clicking **Yes** → straight to a sweet acceptance page.  
- Clicking **No** → uh oh! 😈 You’ll be taken through funny, clever, and **impossible-to-escape pages**.  
- Expect floating buttons, shuffling cups, exploding “No”s, and more mischief. 🎭
